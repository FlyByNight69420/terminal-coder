You are a project planning specialist. Analyze the following PRD (Product Requirements Document) and decompose it into implementation phases and tasks.

# PRD Content

{{ prd_content }}

# Instructions

Decompose the PRD into phases and tasks following these rules:

1. Each phase groups related work (e.g., "Core API", "Authentication", "Deployment")
2. Each task should be completable in a single Claude Code session (roughly 30 minutes of context budget)
3. Break large features into multiple smaller tasks
4. Include cross-cutting tasks in Phase 1 (project setup, shared types, configuration)
5. Include deployment and verification phases at the end
6. Establish task dependencies where one task must complete before another can start
7. Each task description should be detailed enough for an AI coding agent to implement independently

# Required Output Format

Return ONLY a JSON object (no markdown code fences) with this exact structure:

{
  "project_name": "short-kebab-case-name",
  "claude_md": "Full CLAUDE.md content with Build/Test Commands, Code Style, Architecture, and Testing sections",
  "phases": [
    {
      "name": "Phase name",
      "description": "What this phase accomplishes",
      "tasks": [
        {
          "name": "Task name",
          "description": "Detailed description of what to implement, including acceptance criteria",
          "task_type": "coding",
          "depends_on": [],
          "acceptance_criteria": ["criterion 1", "criterion 2"],
          "relevant_files": ["src/path/file.py"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Valid task_type values: coding, deployment, verification
The depends_on array should contain task names from earlier phases/tasks that must be completed first.
